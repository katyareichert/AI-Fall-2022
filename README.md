# [COMS-W4701] Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University

A repository of all the assignments I've completed for this course.

This course followed a rough chronology of the evolution of Aritificial Intelligence, diving into each major development with conceptual
and coding assignments. We discussed numerous topics in AI - including association rules, constraint satisfaction problems, 
adversarial search with alpha-beta pruning. We also explored machine learning techniques such as k nearest neighbors, decision trees, linear
regression, logistic regression, ensemble methods, and bayes nets.
